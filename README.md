# Advanced Optimization Problems with R

This repository contains implementations of various optimization algorithms in R, applied to benchmark problems. It is divided into two main scripts:

1. **Script.R** - Focuses on basic optimization problems and compares several algorithms for performance. 🛠️
2. **Script_Advanced.R** - Implements advanced optimization techniques like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with grid search refinement. 🐜

## Features

### **Script.R**
- Compares multiple algorithms:
  - Monte Carlo 🎲
  - Hill Climbing 🧗
  - Simulated Annealing (SANN) ❄️
  - Tabu Search 🚫
- Benchmark problem: Maximization of the `rubies` function with a penalty for constraint violations. 💎
- Visualizations include:
  - Algorithm performance comparison 📈
  - Convergence plots 🔄

### **Script_Advanced.R**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):** Implements ACO for a multidimensional problem with grid search refinement. 🐜
- **Recursive Grid Search:** Refines the ACO results for better precision. 🔍
- 3D visualization of the objective function with annotated optima. 🖥️
